# Blackjack: The Gathering

This is an on-going project. It currently is a below average implementation of browser-based blackjack which hopefully evolves into an okay implementation of Magic: The Gathering in the browser.

### Built By

Justin Gan
Damien Lowe

### Technologies used

- Ruby on Rails
- ActionCable
- HTML5
- CSS3
- [Deck of Cards API](http://deckofcardsapi.com/)
- [Magic: The Gathering Developers](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/)

### Bugs & Future Fixes

- Update User Interface - make it actually look nice
- Automatically show pocket cards without having to press a button
- Disable buttons that shouldn't be pressed more than once per game e.g. 'pocket cards', 'start game' etc.
- Implement Ace logic
- Implement timer so players can't wait forever
- Improve game state messaging so user's know who still needs to take an action
